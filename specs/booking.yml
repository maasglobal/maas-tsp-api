    This is a API specification of REST endpoints that a Transport Service
    Provider (TSP) should implement to offer their services through the 
    [Whim application](https://whimapp.com/).


    It is written in machine readable 
    [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) format, 
    so that API endpoints, validators and test clients can be generated from the
    documentation.

    ## Terminology

    * **endpoint** Publically resolvable URL either managed by MaaS Global (Whim Backend API) or by TSP (Booking API).

    * **booking** Information about single leg during the customer trip, together with customer information and state.§

    * **journey** Multi-leg journey which user plans via WhimApp. 

    * **leg** Single trip which is performed by TSP. Booking created and contain the state of this trip.

    * **TSP** Transport service provider. MaaS Global partner which offers their services via WhimApp.

    * **route** One of the possible journey. To determine it, we call TSP booking options endpoint to get available offers.

    * **WhimApp** Mobile application or similar which is used by Whim User to perform journeys. Collectively we treat all interaction from the point of WhimApp and user experience during the time user uses application.

    * **Whim backend** Caller of TSP API endpoints. WhimApp never calls TSP endpoints directly. All invocations are done from cloud-native infrastructure managed by MaaS Global.

    * **MaaS Global** MaaS Global is the world’s first true Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) operator with its award-winning Whim app, which provides users all city transport services in one app.

      The following scenario explains the life-cycle of an individual trip
      from a TSP viewpoint. Whenever a new concept (such as an actor or action)
      is represented, it is imprinted in **bold**.


      This scenario, with a few extra details is detailed in the process diagram
      below. It should be noted from the picture that MaaS more often acts as a
      caller than a callee for Transport Service Provider. 


      The cases of how WhimApp interacts with TSP are depicted in 
      [business process diagram](https://cawemo.com/embed/09a7739f-f8ce-4fe4-a5e5-a8f66ecedb8c)

      <html>


      ## Planning a Route

      **User** **queries** for a **Route** with an address or latitude-logitude
      pair from one place to another. WhimApp queries the route from a third party
      **Routing Engine** that contains the data for **TSP** routes. At this point
      WhimApp makes no queries to the TSP - it expects the Routing Engine contains 
      valid GTFS data for the TSP.


      **WhimApp** shows several possible **Plans**, each containing a valid
      **Route** with several **Legs** with a part of a route using a specific
      TSP.


      ## Creating a Booking


      User browses through the Plans and chooses to book a trip. For each Leg
      in the Plan Route, WhimApp creates a new **Booking** by invoking corresponding endpoint in TSP.
      It should be noted that the booking may be hours or days in
      advance - a bit like in booking a hotel. The booking contains the
      individual Leg as the detailed travel plan for the TSP, as well as
      customer contact information.


      TSP receives the booking and confirms the trip. TSP may modify the details
      of the Booking, such as moving the **start location** to closest known
      street address or delaying the Leg **start time**, as long as the
      **end time** can be guaranteed. The Booking is supplemented with
      **booked** state information and additional **terms** latest such as
      the latest **cancellation time**.


      WhimApp checks that the booking succeeded and stores the Booking for future
      reference.


      ## Navigating a Route

      User starts to navigate the Route. WhimApp tracks for the user location to
      know if there are any changes needed in the plan. WhimApp triggers the changes
      for bookings by monitoring the individual Legs.


      WhimApp monitors the Booking terms and Leg **start time**.
      When the actual Leg starts, WhimApp **starts** the Leg and notifies the TSP.
      User or TSP may request changes to the Booking, e.g. in a case of a delay
      or cancellation.


      Each of these scenarios are described below.


      ## Updating a Booking


      A Booking may be updated by a User, WhimApp or TSP when any party receives
      new information that the Leg needs to be changed. Since the update may need
      confirmation from User or a 3rd party system, it is an asynchronous
      operation.


      Either party (WhimApp or TSP) may send an updated Booking with
      **UPDATE_REQUESTED** state. The recipient processes the request
      asynchronously and either confirms the request with **UPDATED** state,
      sends its proposal with **UPDATE_REQUESTED**, or cancels the leg with
      **CANCELLED** state.

      ## Cancelling a Booking


      A Booking may be cancelled by User or WhimApp within **cancellation time** in
      **terms** of the Booking without a specific request. WhimApp sends a modified
      Booking with state **CANCELLED** information. TSP confirms and updates its
      own systems.


      It should be noted that cancellation is an exception case and is likely
      happen only when the user chooses to cancel the whole route Plan.
      Instead, MaaS and/or TSP should update the booking with new information.

      TSP can assume Booking as paid if the cancellation time has passed and no
      cancellation has been received from MaaS.

      ## Paying a Booking

      A Booking may be paid (e.g. confirmed) before the **cancellation time**
      in **terms** has expired. WhimApp sends a modified Booking with **PAID**
      state wich the TSP confirms.

      TSP can assume Booking as paid if the cancellation time has passed and no
      cancellation has been received from WhimApp.


      ## Error Cases

      It may be possible that WhimApp sends an invalid request or the TSP cannot
      fulfill a request. In any such case, TSP may respond with an error. If
      TSP responds with an error, WhimApp assumes the state was not changed (e.g.
      a transaction was rolled back). WhimApp may repeat the request
      with the same or different data later on.


      The same principle applies when TSP is communicating with WhimApp.
