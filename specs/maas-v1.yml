  title: MaaS-TSP
  description: |
    This is a API specification of REST endpoints that a Transport Service Provider (TSP) should implement to receive messages from MaaS. It is written in machine readable [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) format, so thatAPI endpoints, validators and test clients can be generated from the documentation.
    
    In addition to this documentation, MaaS maintains a [reference implementation (**TODO**)](https://github.com/maasglobal/maas-tsp-api) with test cases. It is also running as a [reference service (**TODO**)](https://tsp.maas.global/).
    
    Right now MaaS TSP API consists of the Booking API. In addition, a need for customer feedback API (for mediating customer feedback to a TSP) and administration API (for changing API keys etc.) may be defined.

        Creates a new `Booking` for the TSP in **booked** state. The returned object will be a refrence that is passed back & forth throughout the booking life cycle.
      
        The Booking may be modified in the response, e.g. location being adjusted for a more suitable pick-up location.
        
        In addition, the service may contain a **meta** attribute for arbitrary TSP metadata that the TSP needs later, and **token** attribute depicting how long the current state is valid.
