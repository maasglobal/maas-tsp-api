    **DISCLAIMER** This version of TSP API are **deprecated**. Please consult latest version at source code [repository](https://github.com/maasglobal/maas-tsp-api/)


    This is a API specification of REST endpoints that a Transport Service
    Provider (TSP) should implement to receive messages from MaaS. It is written
    in machine readable [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) format, so thatAPI
    endpoints, validators and test clients can be generated from the
    documentation.


    In addition to this documentation, MaaS maintains a [reference
    implementation (**TODO**)](https://github.com/maasglobal/maas-tsp-api) with
    test cases. It is also running as a [reference service
    (**TODO**)](https://tsp.maas.global/).


    Right now MaaS TSP API consists of the Booking API. In addition, a need for
    customer feedback API (for mediating customer feedback to a TSP) and
    administration API (for changing API keys etc.) may be defined.

        Creates a new `Booking` for the TSP in **booked** state. The returned

        The Booking may be modified in the response, e.g. location being
        adjusted for a more suitable pick-up location.

        In addition, the service may contain a **meta** attribute for arbitrary
        TSP metadata that the TSP needs later, and **token** attribute depicting
        how long the current state is valid.
